      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>We are a small developer team that is passionate about sports. We believe that users should be able to have an easy time accessing all of the data that they care about. At the moment we only have NHL data to display, but our plans are to maintain all major sports league data.</p>

      <p>To access the data that you want, there is a navigation bar at the top of the screen that will have the page that will display the specific data you are looking for. To go back home you can always press on the title in the header so that you can know where you are at all times, or just want to get back to our amazing home page.</p>
